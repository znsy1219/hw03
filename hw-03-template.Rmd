## Data load and preparation before modelling

```{r read_data}
gss16<-read.csv("data/gss16.csv")
```

#### Cleaning and selecting columns

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16 %>%
  select(advfront, emailhr, educ, polviews, wrkstat) %>%
  drop_na()
```

#### Re-levelling `advfront`

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16_advfront %>%
  mutate(
    advfront = case_when(
      advfront == "Strongly agree" ~ "Agree",
      advfront == "Agree" ~ "Agree",
      TRUE ~ "Not agree"
    ),
    advfront = fct_relevel(advfront, "Not agree", "Agree")
  )
```

#### Re-levelling `polviews`

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16_advfront %>%
  mutate(
    polviews = case_when(
      str_detect(polviews, "[Cc]onservative") ~ "Conservative",
      str_detect(polviews, "[Ll]iberal") ~ "Liberal",
      TRUE ~ polviews
    ),
    polviews = fct_relevel(polviews, "Conservative", "Moderate", "Liberal")
  )
```

#### Creating a new `fulltime` variable

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16_advfront %>%
  mutate(fulltime = ifelse(wrkstat == "Working fulltime",TRUE,FALSE))
```

## Exercise 2: Create a workflow to fit a model

```{r split-data}
set.seed(1234)
gss16_split <- initial_split(gss16_advfront)
gss16_train <- training(gss16_split)
gss16_test  <- testing(gss16_split)
```

#### Exercise 3 (a)

```{r}
# replace this with your code
```

*Your answer here*

#### Exercise 3 (b)

```{r}
